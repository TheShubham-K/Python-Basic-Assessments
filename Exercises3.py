"""
TUPLES
Tuple (like the list type this is a data collection type)
Note a pair of numbers 3,4 is referred to as a tuple. There are tuples of
various sizes: 3,4 and 3,4,5 and 3,4,5,6 are all tuples. They do not have to
be numbers. The following are also tuples: 'a,','b' and x, y, z and 
"Morning", "Afternoon", "Evening". In Python we can set tuples equal to other 
tuples as follows:
"""
#%%
x,y = 3,4
print (x,y)
#%%
a,b,c = 10,11,12
print(a,b,c)
print(b)
#%% 
"""
The tuple 4,6,8 is written by Python with parentheses: (4,6,8)
"""   
#%%
4,6,8
#%%
"""
The items in tuples can be accessed much like those in a list, but unlike a
list, a tuple cannot be changed. One cannot add to a tuple or remove an item 
from a tuple. It is said to be immutable. 

Let's define a tuple and look at how to access its items:
"""
#%%
tup = ('a','e','i','o','u')
#%%
""" The following accesses are just like in a list. """
print("tup is", tup)
print(tup[0])
print(tup[1])
print(tup[-1])
print(tup[-2])
print(tup[1:3])
print(tup[:3])
#%%
"""
DICTIONARIES
Dictionary data type (another collection datatype along with list and tuple):
d = {} creates an empty dictionary
d={key1:value1, key2:value2, key3:value3} - use key to find the value
d[key2] gives value2, etc.
Lists and strings are in order and you can use slicing to single out an item:
lis[3] or strg[3] give the item with index 3 in the list or string. This won't
work with dictionaries. So you use d[key] to get the value that goes with key.
Example:
"""
#%%
d = {"Johnny": "5 years old", "Sally": "7 years old", "Eva":"10 years old",
 "Peggy": "7 years old"}
#%%
"""
Try out the following:
d[0] gives an error
d['Sally'] gives '7 years old'
d prints out as
{'Eva': '10 years old',
 'Peggy': '7 years old',
 'Sally': '7 years old',
 'Johnny': '5 years old'}
d.items()         # this gives the items in the form of a list of tuples
d.keys()          # this gives the keys
d.values()        # this gives the values
Note that the order is not the order entered.
Note also that the keys must be unique but the values don't have to be

Accessing. All the following two loops do the same or a similar thing:
"""
#%%
for key,value in d.items():
    print(key, "--> ", value)
#%%
for item in d.items():
    print(item)
#%% 
for item in d.items():
    print(item)
    print(item[0], "--> ", item[1])
#%%
for item in d.items():
    print(item[0], "--> ", item[1])
#%%
for key in d:
    print(key, "--> ", d[key])
#%%
for key in d.keys():
    print(key, "--> ", d[key])
#%%
"""
If you want to see only the values:
"""
#%%
for value in d.values():
    print(value)
#%%
"""    
The following will add the key:value pair "Ted":"5 years old" to d or change
the value if 'Ted' is already a key in d:  
"""
#%%
d['Ted'] = "5 years old"
#%%  
d
#%%
"""
d["sally"] gives an error because "s" is not capitalized
d["Jim"] gives an error because "Jim" is not a key.
d["5 years old"] gives an error because "5 years old" is a value not a key
"""
"""
Exercise: 
Consider the following dictionary of US News and World Reports list of best
affordable sportscars (ascars). Execute the line below so that you have the 
dictionary in your IPython console. Then answer (retrieve) the following.
Press <esc> if you lock up on some step.
a) Type ascars to display the dictionary
b) Using the key retrieve the Nissan sportcar. 
b) Using the key retrieve the Chevy sportscar.
c) Change the MINI Cooper car to a "Coupe". Display ascars to check that it
worked.
d) Write a small 2 line loop to display all the values and only the values
e) Write a small 2 line loop to display all the keys (and only the keys).

Here is the list to execute:
"""

"""
Some summary facts:
Lists can be appended to and items can be addressed by item number.
Tuples are immutable (can't be changed). Item can be addressed by item number.
Dictionaries can be appended to. Items cannot be retrieved by item number,
  because the items have no inherent order. The values can be retrieved by
  using their keys.
"""
"""
Exercise:
Lists, tuples and dictionaries
Let's examine the differences. 
First, lists and tuples are ordered, so this makes sense: lis[2], tup[3] 
Dictionaries are not ordered, so dict[0] returns an error.
Dictionaries don't look items up by index number, but by key; you can't do
this with lists and tuples.
[] is an empty list; () is an empty tuple; and {} is an empty dictionary.
Tuples can't be modified, but lists and dictionaries can.
You can stride lists and tuples, but not dictionaries. Dictionaries have no
notion of order and hence cannot be sliced ([3:7] doesn't mean anything) and
they cannot be strided -- it might appear that you can, but the order is 
unpredictable.
Try the following out and see what works:
"""
#%%
# Execute this cell to create these variables
namelist = ["George", "Sally", "Catherine", "James", "Peggy"]
x,y,z = "George","Sally","Catherine"
mytuple = x,y,z
agedict = {"George":"17","Sally":"19",
             "Catherine":"18"}
#%%
# Which work (you might copy each into IPython and see whether it works)?
namelist[1]   # yes
mytuple[1]    # yes
#agedict[1]    # no      
#%%
# Which work?
namelist.append("Rod")   # yes or no
mytuple.append("Rod")    # yes or no
agedict.append("Rod")    # yes or no
#%%
# Which work?
namelist[1]="Rod"    # yes or no
mytuple[1] = "Rod"   # yes or no
agedict["Rod"]="23"  # yes or no
          
#%%
"""
OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS
Some useful operation system commands for the rest of this lesson:
Mac/unix/Linix
pwd        prints the current working directory
ls         lists the files in the current directory (options -l, -F, -a, -A)
Windows
cd ,       prints the current working directory
dir        lists the files in the current directory (one column)
dir/w      lists the files in the directory "wide" (multi-column)

In an IPython window you can execute many operating system commands by
putting an ! in front of them. On my Windows pc, the above Unix style commands
work without the ! in front.

These might be helpful when reading and writing files, because you either
have to give the full directory path or assume the file is in the 
current working directory and use a relative path. '!cd ,' or '!pwd' will show
you what the current working directory is.

Another note: there is a button to the right of the Global Working Directory 
(this is the path displayed in the upper right of the toolbar) to set the 
displayed path as the current working directory.

"""
Exercise:
Write a function write_to_file(filename,myname,myage,major) that opens the
file <filename> and writes 3 lines in it using the data given. Here is a sample
of what could be in the file. Call the file 'namefile.txt', so that it is 
identifiable as a text file:

My name is George 
My age is 21 
I am majoring in Physics
Tips: 
1. write() can take only a string and, in fact, only one. So whatever you 
write has to be put together into one string (using +, for example).
2. Add +"\n" on the end of each write to put a newline at the end of each 
line. Otherwise, everything will be jammed together on one line.
3. Convert your age (a number) to a string -- use str() to do that. Then join
it to the other parts of the string before writing.
4. When running the function, use quotes around every argument except the 
number.

Use notepad (on pc) or textedit (on Mac) to look at the file to confirm it. An
outline of what needs to be done is given as comments.
"""
#%%

RUNNING STANDALONE SCRIPTS OR PROGAMS.

So far we have been writing Python functions and running them. Now let's 
write a Python program (actually Python calls them 'scripts'). 

To run from command line open a command window in one of two ways:
On windows, from the Start Menu, enter cmd.exe
  -- in this case use cd to change to the directory with print_file.py in it
or
From Spyder, go to menu Tools>Open command prompt
  -- in this case you should be sure that print_file.py is in the directory at 
  -- the top of the screen (Global working directory) or do as in the  
  -- cmd.exe case and use cd to get there.

Once you are in the correct directory, enter the following command at the
">" prompt: python printfile.py <nameoffile to print>

ATTEMPT TO RUN PROGRAMS USING PYTHON 2.7 INSTEAD OF PYTHON 3.4. Macintoshes, 
for example, come with Python 2.7 installed and will have this issue. The 
following works from the Spyder Command prompt regardless, so we will use that.

Exercise:
Now take copy_file from above and convert it to a stand alone program called
copy_file.py.  Actually, I've provided you a starter file named copy_file.py.
Open it and modify it. Then save it and run it in a terminal or command 
window.  Now modify it by adding the import statement above. Since you have two
filenames now, you will need to use sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2] to
get them. Here is copy_file.py that you need to rework:

We now turn to reading/writing CSV files, that is Comma Separated Value files. 
Text files lack the structure that we need for certain applications.  CSV files
can be read or written by spreadsheet programs such as Excel. They may be the 
most common way of transferring files from one application to another.
Summary of CSV file statements:

import csv

infile.close()             # An open file locks other applications out

Exercise:
Rewrite read_csv_file(filename), call it read_csv_file2(filename), so that you 
print each row without the list bracket. You will print each item in the row 
separately instead of printing the whole row. This requires you to know 
before-hand how many columns are in the csv file. In the case of booksread.csv, 
there are 3 items in each row: How do you address each item in the row list
named row? They are row[?] and row[??] and row[???], where you fill in the 
?, ??, and ??? values.

"""
Exercise:
This is a modification of write_csv(filename). Instead of getting the data
from a list, we're going to input it from the keyboard. This new function
name_phone(csv_filename) will put a friend's name and his/her phone number 
into a csv file. Here is a start. We are going to add features to the program 
so that each step is manageable and we don't get confused.
1) Run this program and see that you can enter names and they'll print.
   To exit, you enter a blank name (i.e., just press return or enter).
   Note the loop runs forever, so we have to use 'break' to get out.
2) Add an input statement to collect a phone number and a line to print the
   phone number. Carefully place these so that the program runs nicely; that 
   is, don't print anything until you have the phone number and don't get the
   phone number until you know the user isn't quiting. 
3) Now add writing to a CSV file. After each step you can try running the 
   function to make sure everything works. We're "growing" the program making
   sure that we have a working program each step of the way. You can check
   the work by double clicking on the created file and using Excel to peek into
   it. In the following be careful to put the right statements inside the loop 
   and the others outside the loop.
   a) First add any necessary import statements.
   b) Add a line opening the csv file for writing and a line closing the file. 
   c) As each line written to the CSV file must be a list, create an empty list
      like this: line = []. Note this should be inside the loop. Why?
   d) append the name to line; append the phone to line
   e) write the line to the CSV file

Updating a csv file

Let us read a CSV file containing a person's daily weights and compute the 
average weight and write that into the csv file.
Here we copy the old file to a new one and add an additional line that 
contains the average of all the weight values.  
Note that the first row has a header so we skip it.
Note also that the values are read in as strings and we must convert to float
(i.e., read number) before using a number for arithmetic.
Note that we are writing a new line at the end that contains the average.

In developing this program, we could somehow open a file and not manage to
close it. In which case, we may have to get out of Spyder to unlock the file.
Using a new name for the new file (we're writing to it), can also fix the
problem.

Here is my run on a PC. On a Mac, the command "type" should be "cat":
update_csv("weights.csv","xweights.csv")

!type xweights.csv
Date,Weight
5/1/2016,142
5/2/2016,143
5/3/2016,140
