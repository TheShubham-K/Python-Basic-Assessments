Python has lists. The empty list is []. The following is a list of one
item ["a"] and so is [3]. Here is a list with 3 items ["ball",3.14,-2]. Let's
define a list, I'll call it lis and we'll do things with it to illustrate
accessing items in a list. Execute the following cell with Ctrl-Enter.

""" 
Exercise:
Some of the things that we can do with lists. Let's try them together.
lis[0] is the first element of the list. (index is 0)
lis[1] is the second element of the list and so on. (index is 1)
The length of the list is len(lis) and is the number of items in the list.
lis[-1] is the last item in the list.
lis[2:4] will list items 2 and 3 (but not 4)
lis[:4] will list items 0, 1, 2, 3 (but not 4); that is all items up to 4
lis[3:] will list all items starting with item 3.
lis.append("g") will append "g" onto the end of the list
"a" in lis          # running this statement will return True
"r" in lis          # running this statement will return False
Everything in Python is an object, whether it is a variable like x or a list
like lis. Objects have methods indicated by the dot. So .append() is a method
of the list object. We'll see more of this.
"""
"""
Here is an example function using a list. We pass in a list of items and
it checks for certain animals or flowers in the list.
We'll try it out on several lists such as ['bear'], ['daisy', lion'], etc.

You should make up some lists and pass to 'who_is_there' to see how the if
statements handle various combinations. Some test lists for who_is_there:

The following function illustrates using lists in 'for' loops. Note that the
loop variable 'let' steps through the list, alist, taking the value of each of
its items in turn.

#%%
"""
Note there is a basic design pattern to these lists. Some variable for 
accumulating the results (above it is ct) is initiated before entering the
loop. This variable is updated within the loop. Afterwards that variable is
used (in this case ct is printed out).

Exercise:
Take the following list, nlis, and compute its average. That is, write
a function 'average(numlis)' that uses a 'for' loop to sum up the numbers
in numlis and divide by the length of numlis. Just to be sure that you
got all the numbers in numlis, print each one in your 'for' loop and 
print the length of the the list. When using a loop, one always needs to
be careful that it loops as often as is expected. In this case also print out
the number of items in the list.
Caution: Do NOT use the variable nlis in your function. This function should
work on any list of numbers. Just to be sure make sure that your function
(without any changes) works on rlis as well as nlis.

Lets' talk about data types. For starters Python has integers (e.g., 40), float
or real numbers (e.g., 40.0), string ("hello"), list ( ['a','b','c']), bool
(boolean -- that is, True or False). In Python they are called int, float, 
str, list, bool. You can tell what type a variable x is by entering type(x). 
Here is an example of several:
"""
#%%
x = 17      # integer
y = 3.14    # float
z = "The Walrus and the Carpenter"  # string
z1 = "30"   # string
z2 = '40'   # string
vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u'] # list of strings
nums = ['1','2','3', '3.14'] # list of strings
phrases = ["â€™Twas brillig, and the slithy toves", 
    "Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:"] # list of strings (2 strings, in fact)
r = True    # boolean
s = False   # boolean
#%%
"""
Often you can convert one type to another: int(z1) makes and returns an 
integer (30); float(z2) returns a float or real number (40.0); str(y) returns 
the string "3.14"; etc.
This is important because z1+z2 is not 70 (it is '3040'); however, 
int(z1)+int(z2) is 70. Here is a simple program showing when you might want to 
use this technique.
"""
#%%
def multiply():
    numstr1 = input("Enter a number: ")
    numstr2 = input("Enter another number: ")
    num1 = float(numstr1)
    num2 = float(numstr2)
    print("Their sum is ", num1 * num2)
#    print("Won't work: ", numstr1 * numstr2)

"""
Compare list(range(2,20,3)) and range(2,20,3). The first one is a list and
the second one is what Python calls an iterator. The second one dishes out
the next element in the list each time it is called. This is one of the changes
from Python 2 to Python 3. In Python 2 it was a list and there was a function
xrange() for iterating without building the list. That is gone from Python 3.
Can you think of a reason that using range in Python 2 might not be a good idea
with huge lists?
""" 
#%%   
print(list(range(2,20,3)))
print(range(2,20,3))

"""
Caution: Notice that large numbers never include commas. Compare these two
examples. In the second, Python thinks that it is printing 3 numbers not 1.
"""
print(12345678)
print(12,345,678)

Another caution. The following are Python keywords. They have special meaning
and shouldn't be used as variable names:
and         del     from    not     while
as          elif    global  or      with
assert      else    if      pass    yield

Note: for readability, if you feel that you need to use one of these as a 
variable, you could use an underscore after it. For example, and_, class_, etc.
That makes it different from the Python keyword.
